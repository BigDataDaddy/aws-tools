# Lambda Tool

This tool is intended for easy development and debugging of Lambda Functions, and has three main features:

### 1. Sync data between a local folder and Lambda Function Code:
- Any change on the local folder will be automatically uploaded to the Lambda function
- On the first run you can sync data from Lambda to local folder:
	- If the local folder doesn't exist, it will happen automatically
	- If the code in the local folder is different on the first run, you will be asked before syncing (in case there were local changes made which might get erased)

	**Commands**:
  
	- Continous sync: `lambda sync -d local_folder -f lambda-test`
  
	- One time sync: `lambda sync -d local_folder -f lambda-test -o`

### 2. Invoke Lambda Function
- Invoke a Lambda (with optional payload) and pretty print result and log output

	**Commands**:
  
	- Invoke with payload file: `lambda invoke -f lambda-test -p payload.json`
  
  - Invoke with payload string: `lambda invoke -f lambda-test -t '{"test":"test"}'`
  
	- Invoke without payload: `lambda invoke -f lambda-test`

### 3. Tail Lambda Cloudwatch logs
- Watch for new logs generated by a Lambda Function
	**Command:** `lambda watch -f lambda-test`
